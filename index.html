        <h3>Here's a time line of Sir Alex Ferguson</h3>

        <div id="tribute-info">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1941</strong> - Alexander Chapman Ferguson was born at his grandmother's home on Shieldhall
                    Road in Govan, a suburb of Glasgow</li>
                <li><strong>1957</strong> - Ferguson's playing career began as an amateur with Queen's Park, where he
                    made his debut as a striker, aged 16.</li>
                <li><strong>1974</strong> - Ferguson's time at Falkirk was soured by this and he responded by requesting
                    a transfer and moved to Ayr United, where he finished his playing career.

                </li>
                <li><strong>1974</strong>- In June, Ferguson was appointed manager of East Stirlingshire, at the
                    comparatively young age of 32. It was a part-time job that paid £40 per week, and the club did not
                    have a single goalkeeper at the time.</li>
                <li><strong>1978</strong>- Ferguson joined Aberdeen as manager replacing Billy McNeill who had only
                    managed the club for one season before he was offered the chance to manage Celtic.</li>
                <li><strong>1983</strong> - Ferguson led Aberdeen to even greater success the following season, 1982–83.
                    They had qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup as a result of winning the Scottish Cup the
                    previous season, and impressively knocked out Bayern Munich, who had beaten Tottenham Hotspur 4–1 in
                    the previous round. According to Willie Miller, this gave them the confidence to believe that they
                    could go on to win the competition, which they did, with a 2–1 victory over Real Madrid in the
                    final.</li>
                <li><strong>1986 </strong>- Ferguson was appointed manager at Old Trafford on 6 November 1986. He was
                    initially worried that many of the players, such as Norman Whiteside, Paul McGrath and Bryan Robson
                    were drinking too much and was "depressed" by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the
                    players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been
                    21st (second from bottom) when he took over.</li>
                <li><strong>1993-94 </strong> - The 1993–94 season brought more success. Ferguson added Nottingham
                    Forest's 22-year-old midfielder Roy Keane to the ranks for a British record fee of £3.75 million as
                    a long term replacement for Bryan Robson, who was nearing the end of his career. United led the
                    1993–94 Premier League table virtually from start to finish.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1995-98</strong> - The youngsters, who would be known as "Fergie's Fledglings", included
                    Gary Neville, Phil Neville, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, who would all go on to be
                    important members of the team. And so the 1995–96 season began without a major signing, at a time
                    when the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle were making the headlines with big-money
                    signings.

                    A youthful United team lost 3–1 in their opening league game of the 1995–96 season, against Aston
                    Villa. On Match of the Day, pundit Alan Hansen criticised their performance, ending his analysis
                    with the words, "You can't win anything with kids."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1998-99</strong> - Ferguson, interviewed moments after winning Champions League and
                    completing treble, said, "I can't believe it. Football, bloody hell. But they never gave in and
                    that's what won it."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2000-2001</strong> - In the 2000–01 season, United retained the league title for a third
                    season, becoming only the fourth side in history to do so.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2008</strong> - On 11 May 2008, Ferguson led Manchester United to a tenth Premier League
                    title, exactly 25 years to the day after he led Aberdeen to European glory against Real Madrid in
                    the Cup Winners' Cup.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2008-09</strong> - Although the team had a slow start to the 2008–09 season, United won the
                    Premier League with a game to spare,[184] making Ferguson the first manager in the history of
                    English football to win the top division three times consecutively, on two separate occasions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2010-11</strong> - He ended the following season by winning his 12th and Manchester United's
                    19th league title and thus overtaking Liverpool's record of 18. He put Manchester United on perch of
                    English football.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2013</strong> - On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the
                    end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. The
                    Guardian announced it was the "end of an era".
                </li>
                <li><strong>2014</strong> - Ferguson was appointed as the UEFA Coaching Ambassador, and said it was "an
                    honour and a privilege" to be given the role. In April 2014, it was announced that Ferguson would be
                    taking up a "long-term teaching position" at Harvard University, where he would be lecturing on a
                    new course titled "The Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports".</li>
